# 🎥 Video Catalog & Management Application

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to the **Video Catalog & Management Application** repository!  
This application will allow users to catalog, view, and manage videos stored on their desktop. Key features will include:

- Batch metadata scanning for videos.
- Automatic thumbnail generation for previews.
- A GUI for viewing and streaming videos from the catalog.
- Machine learning capabilities to identify potential duplicate videos.

## 🛠️ Features
### 1. Batch Video Processing
- Scan a designated folder to extract metadata from videos.
- Generate 2-3 thumbnails for quick previews during import.

### 2. GUI
- A front-end interface for seamless video browsing.
- Streaming functionality integrated into the app.

### 3. Machine Learning
- ML-based analysis to detect duplicates based on file attributes, metadata, or content similarity.

## 💻 Tech Stack
The **Video Catalog App** will utilize the following:

- **Python** for backend logic.
- **GUI Libraries:** Options include [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) or frameworks like [PyQt/PySide](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) for the GUI interface.
- **Database:** SQLite or another ORM solution to store video metadata.
- **Machine Learning:** Open-source ML libraries like `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, or `PyTorch`.

## 🌟 **1. Overview**  

The **Media Catalog Application** is an intelligent system that scans directories, validates media types dynamically, and saves important media file metadata to a database.

It's modular, scalable, extensible, and uses modern design patterns to maintain maintainability and flexibility for the future.  

---

## 🛠️ **2. Features Overview**

These are the *killer features* of the Media Catalog Application:

### ✅ **Core Features**

1. 📂 **Media Directory Scanning:**  
   - Scans user-provided directories for media files (audio, video, images).  

2. 🛡️ **Dynamic Media Type Validation:**  
   - Uses multiple validation strategies to dynamically validate file types through extensions.

3. 🖥️ **Database Integration with SQLAlchemy ORM:**  
   - Saves file metadata like *path, size, resolution, codec, duration*, and more.  

4. 🚧 **Error Handling & Logging:**  
   - Robust error handling for invalid media types, failed database inserts, or invalid paths.

5. 🏗️ **Extensible Architecture:**  
   - Designed with flexibility in mind: new media types & strategies can be added easily without breaking the system.

---

## 🎯 **3. Design Decisions & Architectural Patterns**

The system employs proven design patterns and architectural decisions to make the system robust, modular, and maintainable.

### **Design Patterns Employed**

1. ⚙️ **Strategy Pattern**  
   - Allows the system to dynamically select media validation logic at runtime.
   - Example: `VideoValidationStrategy`, `AudioValidationStrategy`, `ImageValidationStrategy`.  

2. 🧩 **Composite Pattern**  
   - Enables combining multiple validation strategies into a single composite validator seamlessly.  

3. 🏠 **Repository Pattern**  
   - Abstracts database interaction logic away from core business logic. Keeps code modular and testable.

---

## 🏗️ **4. Architecture & System Design**

The application is broken into modular components to ensure scalability and extensibility.

---

### 🏆 **High-Level Architecture**

The application consists of these key components:

| Component           | Description                                                                                      | Icon  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| 🔍 **MediaScanner**   | Central driver of the application, coordinates directory scanning.                              | 🕵️‍♂️ |
| 🗂️ **DirectoryScanner**  | Scans directories and validates files dynamically using injected validation logic.              | 📂 |
| 🛡️ **MediaTypeService**   | Validates media types through file extensions.                                                 | 🔎 |
| ⚙️ **CompositeValidationStrategy** | Dynamically combines multiple validation strategies.                                            | 🧩 |
| 🛠️ **Media Repository & Database Logic**  | Manages database interactions using SQLAlchemy ORM.                                           | 💾 |

### **ER Diagram**

📊 **Entity Relationship Diagram Placeholder:**  
_(If diagrams were enabled, you would see relationships like `MediaType <-> Media`)._

---

### **Class Diagram**

🖌️ **Class Diagram Placeholder:**  
(Shows classes like `MediaScanner`, `CompositeValidationStrategy`, `DirectoryScanner`, `MediaTypeService`, and relationships between them.)

---

### ⚙️ **Sequence Diagram**

🔄 Sequence flow showing media scanning, type identification, and saving logic:

1. `MediaScanner` triggers scanning.  
2. `DirectoryScanner` identifies valid media paths using **CompositeValidationStrategy**.  
3. Valid media are processed, and their metadata is saved to a database.

---

## ❌ **5. Challenges Faced**

1. 🕵️‍♀️ **Dynamic Strategy Loading Issues:**  
   - Initially, errors occurred with dynamic validation logic (`CompositeValidationStrategy`). Fixed by modular reorganization.

2. 💾 **Database Schema & Media Integrity:**  
   - SQLAlchemy's database schema constraints initially led to challenges. Ensured MediaType entries exist before saving.

3. 🛡️ **Metadata Extraction & Missing Attributes:**  
   - Some scans failed due to missing expected metadata values. Added robust error handling.

---

## 🔮 **6. Next Steps**

Here’s what we plan to do moving forward:

1. 🚀 **Implement CLI User Input Interface:**  
   Allow users to scan directories easily through a command-line interface.

2. 📈 **Dynamic Extension Support:**  
   Add support for more media types like PDFs, e-books, and document formats.

3. 🛠️ **Improve Error Recovery Mechanisms:**  
   Allow retry logic and better error recovery paths for database failures.

4. 📊 **Add Media File Caching for Faster Scans:**  
   Speed up repeated directory scans by leveraging media file caching.

5. 📚 **Complete Documentation:**  
   - Update internal diagrams and explain recent schema changes.

# üé• Video Catalog & Management Application

## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to the **Video Catalog & Management Application** repository!  
This application will allow users to catalog, view, and manage videos stored on their desktop. Key features will include:

- Batch metadata scanning for videos.
- Automatic thumbnail generation for previews.
- A GUI for viewing and streaming videos from the catalog.
- Machine learning capabilities to identify potential duplicate videos.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### 1. Batch Video Processing

- Scan a designated folder to extract metadata from videos.
- Generate 2-3 thumbnails for quick previews during import.

### 2. GUI

- A front-end interface for seamless video browsing.
- Streaming functionality integrated into the app.

### 3. Machine Learning

- ML-based analysis to detect duplicates based on file attributes, metadata, or content similarity.

## üíª Tech Stack

The **Video Catalog App** will utilize the following:

- **Python** for backend logic.
- **GUI Libraries:** Options include [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) or frameworks like [PyQt/PySide](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) for the GUI interface.
- **Database:** SQLite or another ORM solution to store video metadata.
- **Machine Learning:** Open-source ML libraries like `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, or `PyTorch`.

Let's establish the initial repository structure for your video catalog application with clear scalability and modularity in mind.

### üìù **Steps to Define Database Schema**

#### 1. **Identify Metadata Requirements**

Video metadata should include:

- **File Information:**
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `file_name` (Name of the video file)
  - `file_path` (Full path to the video)
  - `file_size` (File size in bytes)
  - `created_at` (File creation timestamp)
  - `modified_at` (Last modification timestamp)

- **Video-Specific Information:**
  - `duration` (Length of the video in seconds)
  - `resolution` (Width x Height)
  - `frame_rate` (Frames per second)
  - `codec` (Video codec used)
  - `bitrate` (Video bitrate in kbps)

- **Thumbnails:**
  - `thumbnail_path` (Path to the generated thumbnail(s), if applicable)
